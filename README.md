# A custom Next.js sitebuilder with Sanity Studio, tailwindcss using typescript

## Configuration

### Step 1. Set up the project locally

In the `.env` file and any other file that contains the sanity IDo0 update the sanity variables.

### Step 2. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

When you run this development server, the changes you make in your frontend and studio configuration will be applied live using hot reloading.

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000][localhost-3000]! You can create and edit content on [http://localhost:3000/studio][localhost-3000-studio].

The localhost:3000 needs to be manually added in sanity at https://www.manage.sanity.io
